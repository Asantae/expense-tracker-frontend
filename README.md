Expense Tracker - Frontend
This is the frontend part of the Expense Tracker application built with React, TypeScript, and Create React App (CRA). It provides an interface to manage and track your expenses.

Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
Create React App (CRA): A tool to set up a React project with a good default configuration.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.
CSS: For styling the components.
Setup
Prerequisites
Before running the frontend, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js: Download and install Node.js
npm: Comes with Node.js (package manager)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd expense-tracker-frontend
Install dependencies:

bash

Environment Variables
You can set an environment variable to point to the backend API. For local development, the backend is assumed to run at http://localhost:5221.

In your .env file, you can add:

bash
Copy code
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5221/api/expense
This allows you to make requests to the backend.

bash
Copy code
npm start
This will run the app at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
